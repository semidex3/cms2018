//------------------------------------------------------------------------ Story Missions=

MissionDesc1=A year and a half ago I bought this car for my son. He said that he's not interested in anything except driving it and occasionally filling it up at the gas station. Please check the oil and the tires.
MissionDesc2=I read in a newspaper that the timing components should be replaced more frequently than recommended by the manufacturer. The same goes for the oil! Please check both of those things and replace whatever you decide is needed.
MissionDesc3=Hey! I’m RoadMaster1234! That's what they call me on the Internet! I’m a master behind the steering wheel... in games! Now I got a real machine and I’ll show those disbelievers what I can do on a real road! So please do something with these rims because they slow me down! Oh, and I think something is not right with the engine, it’s making a strange banging noise. Take care!
MissionDesc4=When driving through a city I didn’t notice a speed bump. Please check the front suspension, because I have an impression that something is not right...
MissionDesc5=I bought this machine from a friend of mine who needed money quickly. He assured me that the car was fine, but I feel it pulling to the right... and this strange smell... like mushrooms? From what I remember, he works behind a desk, not in sales... Anyway, check what's wrong with it and make it usable.
MissionDesc6=My car doesn’t start anymore. When it used to run it made strange noises. Every morning I would wake up my entire neighborhood. Please make it start and see if you can do something so it's not so darn loud.
MissionDesc7=I bought this car from a dealer. It wasn’t the cheapest but supposedly it was a good deal! The problem is that it's very difficult to shift through gears... and sometimes something bangs on the left side...and the right side too. Check the general condition of the car and repair whatever you find broken. The dealer ensured me that everything is nearly brand new!
MissionDesc8=Hello! I bought a brand new Olsen Grand Club! It’s a great car. In the ad it said that the car is great for off-roading but I have an impression that driving a SUV on the sand dunes was not a good idea. Something is scraping and I noticed a leak... Please do something about it. I need the car for an off-road trip with my friends this weekend.
MissionDesc9=I was on my way back from a party and... I believe I might have hit a rather large pot hole or something. Please assess the damage and make any necessary repairs... this car belongs to my father-in-law...
MissionDesc10=Good afternoon. I had a small accident on the express way. An 18 wheeler pushed me off the road. I know that the car does not look so great anymore but I cannot afford anything else right now. I just need it to run.
MissionDesc11=Hello, it's me again... It seems that my last trip was a bit too much for me and my car which has lost a little bit of weight. I was told by the people at the dealership that all this is because I had the wrong tires fitted. Please install correct off-road tires on the car and do whatever is necessary to make it drivable again. I'm planning on driving this car through Siberia two weeks from now.
MissionDesc12=I became a victim of a failure... The manufacturer claims that it's all my fault that the ABS pump has failed and the brakes locked up. It all went down hill from there... I started sliding and got a few scraches on the car. The important bit is that I am OK. Look the car over and repair anything that's broken. I recon that aside from the brakes I could use a new steering wheel. A new airbag would be a good idea too.
MissionDesc13=Hello. I was recently away on a two week business trip and I let my husband use my car during that time. Now that I'm back, something has to go! And I mean the husband, not the car. See what he did to it as I don't really have the time to describe it all. I'm on my way to my lawyer to take care of the divorce papers. Just let me know when the car is ready.
MissionDesc14=Hey man! It's me again and I need your help again. My street racer career is progressing nicely and now that I've made some money from some Internet videos I am ready to tweak my beast a little. You know, when the light goes green and I really step on it I feel that I have to work harder than before. By the way, the car doesn't feel as comfortable as it should. Do something about that interior and see if the engine needs a tune-up or something. See Ya!
MissionDesc15=Hi, A while back I got a car which just recently stopped working... I have no idea what happened as I don't know much about cars. My ex-wife says that I'm a loser but driving cars is not, as they say, rocket surgery or... was it brain science? Umm... Anyway, see what bits are missing and what needs to be fixed.
MissionDesc16=Hello, it's me again. My last purchase was not as great as I've hoped for but this time I've found a true gem for my wife. Those internet auctions are a treasure trove of great used cars plus I did everything "couch potato style" - from my couch! I haven't seen the car yet but judging from the pictures I don't believe it needs a lot work. The car is coming straight to your garage. Please check the oil and make any necessary repairs. Thanks!
MissionDesc17=Yo dude! I need to get rid of my car and I need you to make it pretty. You know, people like shiny things so, make it shine! It's almost brand new so there's not much to do. You can do it!
MissionDesc18=I've got something unique for you! Together with a friend of mine I have saved a little race car from the junk jard. I want to give it another chance at life and I want to race this car on an actual race track. To do that, this little baby needs to run first and this is where you come in. Do your best and make it really fast! I don't care how it looks I just want it to go like... you know what.
MissionDesc19=Hello my friend. It's me again, the off-road maniac. I have a feeling that my Grand Club doesn't really seem fit for real off-road adventures or it might just be my bad luck. On top of that a bunch of crazy wild bears decided to chew on my poor car. Some body parts got eaten so please replace them and make any necessary repairs. Thank you.
MissionDesc20=This vehicle has been passed down from generation to generation. When my father was my age he got it from his father. Unfortunately my dad never got a driver's license and the car just sat in a barn all those years. Now that it was passed on to me I want to restore it to its former glory. Please do whatever you can to make this classic beauty look and drive like a new car again.
MissionDesc21=Hello. It's time to renew the registration on this car and that means passing inspection. It doesn't have to be perfect, I just need it to pass. Please take a look at it and see what you can do. Thank you.
MissionDesc22=My car has some serious steering issues. I don't feel safe driving it anymore. Please fix whatever is wrong with it. Thank you.
MissionDesc23=My Bolthorn Grand Mojave is my workhorse at my vineyard. To be honest, I don't go easy on it. It's been fine but recently it just became uncomfortable. The interior needs some much needed attention too. See what you can do with it. Thank you. 
MissionDesc24=Hello. What can I say... those used car dealers are a special kind. My Crown which I recently got from one those clowns is becoming worst with each passing day. Do a general inspection and replace any worn out parts. Thanks!
MissionDesc25=This is a limited edition Kieran. At the price that I've paid it was practically a steal. The problem is that it sat in a barn for a while. Check it out to see if it was a great find or just a piece of junk. Either way, please fix it up for me. Money is no issue here.Just make it pretty.
MissionDesc26=My students are complaining that the clutch is very heavy. Another issue is that we had a little incident recently that ended in a close encounter with a curb at a fairly high rate of speed. After the incident I've noticed something dripping from under the car. I'd like you to go over the car and fix whatever you find so my young drivers are not afraid of getting behind the wheel of this car.
MissionDesc27=Hi, it's me again and this time with a new set of wheels. My Bianco has unfortunately lost a battle with the Internet haters and... well, that's history. I got a new car now, I mean it's new to me. There's a "little bit" of a rust issue but I'm sure it's going to be no problem for you. By the way, have a look under the hood and make sure everything is in order. See ya!
MissionDesc28=I just got back from a long trip. There were no issues along the way but I'd like you to check the overall condition of my car. Thank you.
MissionDesc29=Hello! I need your help as I'm in a hurry. I've heard that you're the man to go to. I was on my way to work and I've heard something that sounded like something had snapped. Moments later the car just died and I noticed that it left a puddle of some sort of liquid on the road. Please see what's wrong with my baby and repair whatever you find. I'm already late for work!
MissionDesc30=I just bought this pile of junk. The seller said that "a few bits might be missing"... it seems that he had an interesting sense of humor. The price was right so I got it anyway. See what parts are missing and do whatever that needs to be done. Thanks.
MissionDesc31=Hello. A friend of mine has recommended you as being the expert to go to. Anyway, I bought this car at an auction. I guess it was used as a parts donor but I've decided to fix her up. See what parts are missing and put her back together. Thank you.
MissionDesc32=Hello. My SUV is great on road but I feel that I shouldn't abuse it off-road. So, I've saved up a bit and I've got something special from a friend of mine. That thing should be well suited for some crazy off-roading. I hope I can really push it just like the previous owner did. See what needs to be fixed and change that awful interior. It doesn't go with my style.
MissionDesc33=Hey. I'm a car mechanic just like you! At least I'm trying to be. My wife thinks that I don't know what I'm doing and since I don't want to give her the satisfaction she has no idea that I'm here. See how I did fixing my car and if you find anything wrong, make it right. And if my wife ever asks... I was never here! Thanks man!
MissionDesc34=Hi. I got this old race car so I can go crazy on the race track. For safety reasons the car must be in perfect condition. I believe that you know exactly what needs to be done.
MissionDesc35=Hello, it's me again. My wife has lost control of the car while driving on a wet road. Fortunately she didn't hit anything. It makes me wonder if there is something wrong with the steering as I can feel the car pulling to one side and sometimes I can hear some strange noises coming from the front wheels. See if you can fix it as I just don't want to deal with those used car dealers anymore. I can't afford a new car just yet.
MissionDesc36=Sup Boss! I brought you another piece of junk...err, I mean, another gem that I'm putting out for sale. It seems that the previous owner didn't go easy on it. Remember, it has to shine! Oh, it would be nice if it run too. Let me know when you're done.
MissionDesc37=Hello. I came here because I've heard that when it comes to cars you really know your business. Here's my daughter's car which she got as a gift from her grandparents. She takes good care of it... at least when it comes to how it looks. Technical stuff, on the other hand, is not really her strong side. Just recently she needed to add some engine oil and she managed to pour in the wrong kind of oil. You know what that means. Do a thorough inspection of the car and repair whatever you find wrong with it.
MissionDesc38=Heeey! I got some cold hard cash from my sponsors and that means I can finally make some much needed changes and repairs. Repaint my car! I've always heard that red cars are always faster. Next, check the wheels and tires and see if anything else might need any attention. I'm noticing some griding when I shift between gears and when I accelerate. Just fix whatever you find wrong with it. See ya!
MissionDesc39=Hello. I've found this car slowly sinking into the ground in my grandfather's back yard. I was told that it used belong to my aunt but she doesn't want it anymore and that I can have it. I thought "great", but in this condition there's not much I can do with it. I've heard great things about you and thought that you might be able to revive it. See if you can bring this classic car back to its former glory.
MissionDesc40=Good morning! I was told that you are an honest mechanic and a trustworthy person. So, I present to you my baby - DC Typhoon. It used to reach speeds of an F5 tornado on a track... but that was a long time ago. I want you to make this car look and drive like new again. I'm counting on you!
MissionDesc41=Hi. My new purchase has paid off. This Castor is much better for off-roading than my SUV. Unfortunately my bad luck is still with me... and I've had a little mishap in the forrest. It's a long story, you know me and you know of my great ideas that I sometimes get. I hope you won't give up on me when you see the car. Do whatever you can and fix it up please.
MissionDesc42=Hello. It's been a while since my last visit but that only speaks about the quality of your work. My car as well as my wife's car finally run as they should from day one. They are just perfect. So, today I'm bringing you my daughter's car which she just purchased. Even to my untrained eye this thing is just hopeless... I always thought that she is at least as sensible as her dad but... I'll let you be the judge.
MissionDesc43=How's it going? I've bought this car at an auction. The general condition of the car is great and the only problem is the engine. I thought that I'd be able to take care of it myself, but it didn't work out so great... I took it apart and... I have apparently lost a few things and a few of them just broke. Please take a look under the hood, see what's missing and do whatever you can to make the car run again.
MissionDesc44=Hi. I've bought this piece of junk for almost nothing from an old man who needed the money. I don't know whether it is worth anything. Do a general overhaul and I'll decide what to do with it later.
MissionDesc45=What's up? I already have 5 million subscribers and a lot of sponsors! It's time to treat myself to a new set of wheels! I knew exactly where I should go first with my new purchase! Here is my almost new Elenti Calliope! This small beast is just perfect for me! Even though it doesn't look or sound the best... and it doesn't run as it should, I'm sure you can handle it! Thanks in advance! See you later!
MissionDesc46=Hey. I had to upgrade to a larger car in a hurry as my family has gotten bigger and our small coupe was just not fit for all of us including the newborn. I've decided on a particular model a while ago and now that I got it I have to say that it's not really the best example of "resonable". Still, I like it, so please fix it up and make it comfortable for me and my family. Thanks!
MissionDesc47=Hello. I work at an automotive museum and I'd like ask you to restore this beautiful historical car. If you do well, I think we'll be able to establish a long term business relation with you. We have many classics in desperate need of attention. Money is of no issue. Good luck.
MissionDesc48=Hello. I've heard that you are about to go on vacation. Well, before you go, hear this - I got lucky and I've won the lottery! I have already sold my old Castor and decided to get a Rex this time. Unfortunately I didn't think straight in my excitement and instead of buying a brand new one I got this one because I fell in love with this color. Smart, wasn't it? Anyway, could you please refresh it a little? Just do a sort of "overhaul" and see what's wrong with it. I'm pretty certain not everything is working as it should. See you later!
MissionDesc49=Hello. I've just bought a car of my dreams at an auction. I do realize that it's not in top condition but I believe that a mechanic of such reputation will be able to indentify and repair all issues.
MissionDesc50=Hello, hello! It's your favourite dealer - Mike! This is the last pile of junk I'm bringing to you this season, I promise. I understand that this isn't the best thing to happen to you right before your vacation but please do your best. I'm going to keep this car for myself so, you know... everything has to be shiny and new! I believe in you! Oh, one more thing - don't get scared when you look under the hood!
